# Hands On Machine Learning with Sci-Kit Learn and TensorFlow OREILLY

## Machine Learning Is Great For
  - Problems for which wxisting solutions require a lot of fine tuning or long lists of rules: one machine learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach.
  - Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solution: the best Machine Learning techniques can perhaps find a solution.
  - Fluctuating environments: a machine learning system can adapt to new data
  - Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.
